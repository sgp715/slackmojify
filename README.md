# slackmojify
Takes a JPG, GIF, or PNG. And makes it uploadable as a custom slackmoji.

## Rules of The Duel
Images can be JPG, GIF, or PNG, up to 128 pixels in width and height, and a maximum 64KB file size. We recommend using a small, square picture, as Slack will resize the image to fit neatly inside a row of text.
